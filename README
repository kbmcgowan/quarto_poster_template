Open a pdf file (above) to see an example.

If you're a lab member looking to get started making your own poster in R studio, you just need to:
- download the code (Code > Download Zip)
- copy or rename one of the example .qmd files
- edit this file to change title, authors, department, and your content
- fine tune font sizes in the YAML header
- add line breaks with '\' on a separate line to adjust spacing

Let someone else know if you need/want access to the repository to make changes to the template.

Non lab members, you should probably not use this fork.
